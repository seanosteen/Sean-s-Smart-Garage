Sean's Smart Garage Control Center
==========

In 2012, before most of the major garage door opener manufacturers released web connected apps, I created one to control the door and lights in my garage and on the front of my house.  The hardware is Arduino Uno/Ethernet based. It communicates with a web app via JSON. All commands are REST verbs.
